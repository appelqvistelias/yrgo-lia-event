```SQL
create table public.programs (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  program_name text not null,
  constraint programs_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint programs_program_name_key unique (program_name)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

### specializations
```SQL
create table public.specializations (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  specialization_name text not null,
  constraint specialization_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint specialization_specialization_name_key unique (specialization_name)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

### roles
```SQL
create table public.roles (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  role text not null,
  constraint roles_pkey primary key (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;

  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  constraint students_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint students_user_id_fkey foreign KEY (user_id) references users (id) on update CASCADE on delete CASCADE
